**OpenCV**, or Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. It provides various tools and functions for real-time computer vision applications. OpenCV was originally developed by Intel in 1999 and has since been continually updated and expanded by a community of contributors.

**OpenCV.js** is a JavaScript binding for OpenCV, which allows you to run OpenCV algorithms in the browser. **OpenCV.js** is generated by compiling the C++ code of OpenCV into JavaScript using **Emscripten**, a tool for compiling C and C++ code into JavaScript. More about OpenCV you can find [here](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html).

To read a user's camera feed in a web browser, you can use the [MediaDevices API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices). In this example the [MediaStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStream) object from camera passed to `<video>` tag as `srcObject` property. Later, frames from the video are captured with `cv.VideoCapture` and handled with `cv`. In this demo, the mirror effect is simply achieved by two `OpenCV` methods: first, converting image to grayscale, and then adding a border to the edges.

```js
cv.cvtColor(sourceMat, grayMat, cv.COLOR_RGBA2GRAY);
cv.copyMakeBorder(
  grayMat,
  borderMat,
  this.height / 2,
  this.height / 2,
  this.width / 2,
  this.width / 2,
  cv.BORDER_DEFAULT,
  s
);
```
